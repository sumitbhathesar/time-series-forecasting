# time-series-forecasting

Time Series Forecasting, where I built a predictive model using Linear Regression to analyze trends in time series data.
The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, training a model, and evaluating predictions to forecast future values accurately.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in: 
âœ… Handling time series data using Pandas & NumPy
âœ… Visualizing trends with Matplotlib
âœ… Building a predictive model using Scikit-Learn
âœ… Evaluating performance with Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

ðŸ“Š The model successfully captured patterns in the dataset, and the predictions closely aligned with actual values. 
This is just the beginningâ€”Iâ€™m excited to explore more advanced forecasting techniques like ARIMA & LSTMs!

A huge thanks to Mindshift Technologies for inspiring innovation in AI & Machine Learning.
Looking forward to connecting with fellow data enthusiasts!
